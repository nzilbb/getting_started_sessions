# We load two packages from the 'tidyverse' by name. `dplyr` includes functions
# for manipulating data. `readr` includes a series of functions for reading
# data in to R.

# If you don't have these two packages use `install.packages('tidyverse')`
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# This package helps to manage the paths to files.
